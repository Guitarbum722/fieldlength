# qualified

A simple library to deal with delimited strings that _could_ contain the delimiter in the data itself.


### Features
* Split strings by a delimiter and escape the delimiter character if contained in a qualified text field.
    * ex. `one,two,"three,four",five`

* Get a map that contains the length of each field
